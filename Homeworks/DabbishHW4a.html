  <li>Problem 3
    <ol>
      <li>In the context of Problem 1, part g), suppose that in fact \tau_1 = \tau_2, \tau_3 = \tau_4 = \tau_1 - d\sigma. What is the distribution of the F statistic?</li>
      <li>Use R to plot the power of the \alpha = 0.05 level test as a function of /d/ for /d/ \in [-5,5], that is plotting /P/ (F > the cut-off value) against /d/. The R function pf(q,df1,df2,ncp) will compute cumulative (non-central) F probabilities for you corresponding to the value q, for degrees of freedom df1 and df2 when the noncentrality parameter is ncp.</li>
